# Eye Movement Project
## Description: 
This project is about listening to the mouse movement event and using it to the update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the webpage. There are two eyes elements displayed on the screen that moves synchronously with the movement of the mouse, so when the user moves the mouse it looks like the eyes are moving. 

## How to Run:
* Fork and clone the repository locally.
* Run the index.html file on a web browser.
* Move your cursor across the screen.
* The eye should move along the diretion of the cursor. 

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Change color and size of eyeball when the user clicks anywhere in the webpage.
